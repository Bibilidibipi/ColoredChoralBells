chords attract faeries!
intro with black & white stick figure/claymation walking out of house and tilling garden
outro with return to house in color
bees evolve to more efficiently collect the frequencies that exist
spend $ to evolve
tones start out even-tempered and can evolve to just-tuned based on other tones?
again, spend $ (evolve points?) 
only when a just-tuned chord exists does a faerie appear
where do evolve points come from?
faeries eat tone honey

mouse also collects 'joy'? harmonic honey is just more efficient; start out with only 'joy'
  and hH must be earned by buying beehives

Scrap the just tuning idea for now.
But do add accidentals.

Play Halleluja - "magic chord" - when a faerie appears?

bees change in appearance when they evolve - make it obvious somehow.
